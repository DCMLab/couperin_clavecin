# Alternative harmony annotations

These are two alternative analyses of the first four Pr√©ludes. They come in form of the usual 'expanded' TSV files and the four scores contain a comparison between the two. 

The TSV files with the suffix `_AN` represent the annotations made by the original annotator Adrian Nagel. Those with the suffix `_JM` contain reviews undertaken by Johannes Menke.

The scores compare JM's reviewed versions against AN's original in the following way:

* unchanged labels are shown in black
* labels removed by JM are shown in red
* labels added by JM are shown in green
